= Reported participants

== Understand the basics

There are instances where participants might violate the Terms and Conditions of the
platform, so it's useful to have the option for reporting and blocking participants.
You can block participants from the xref:participants/participants.adoc[participants
section in the administration panel] or through the "Reported participants" section.

== Konfiguration

=== Report a participant

Any logged in participant can report another participant through the "Report" button in the participant
profile.

After a participant has clicked in this action they need to provide a reason why they're making this report:

When an administrator or a moderator report a participant, they have additional options that allow them to
directly block the user and hide all their contents. They have to provide a justification for blocking this participant.

=== Manage reported participants

Reported participants are visible on the "Reported participants" section of the Global moderations panel.

You can find all the reported participants on the reported participant list in the administration panel, with:

* *Name*: Name of the participant, with a link to their profile.
* *Nickname*: Nickname of the participant, with a link to their profile.
* *Reason*: Why the participant is being reported. If the participant that made the report has given extra
information, it's possible to see it by hovering over it.
* *Reported at*: When they were originally reported.
* *Reports count*: Number of reports by different users.
* *Actions*: You can *Unreport* or *Block* the participant.

=== Block a participant

If content has been mistakenly "unreported" then you'll need to find it again in the public platform
and report it again so you can moderate it.

Administrators need to provide a justification if they want to block a participant.
They can also define xref:templates/block_users.adoc[block user messages templates] to have predefined justifications.

When a blocked participant tries to log-in, they will see an error message:

Blocked participants' names change to "Blocked user."

== Understand the basics

In some cases it is necessary to organize assemblies by more than just children and sub-assemblies.
This is where assemblies types can be useful, and add a layer of categorization.
Participants are then able to filter assemblies by the assembly types you created.

NOTE: Assembly types work similarly to xref:admin:spaces/processes/types.adoc[Process types].

=== Add assembly type to an assembly

To relate assemblies to assembly types, in the edition page of an assembly, select the assembly type under the section labelled Other.

=== Filter by assembly types

If there is at least one assembly type defined and related to an assembly, a filter is displayed at the left of the assemblies list
in the participant interface, allowing filtering of assemblies.

=== Participate as a group

NOTE: For user group administrators to be able to participate as a group, an administrator of the instance must have verified it.

The interest of having an administrator verify the user group is that you can then participate to the platform as a group,
and create debates, proposals, meetings, comments, etc.

Administrators of the user group can for example comment in the name of their group.

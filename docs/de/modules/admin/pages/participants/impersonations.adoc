= Participants impersonations

Sometimes, people don't have the time to create an account, or don't have the knowledge or ability to use technological tools.
Impersonations allow administrators and participant managers to enable those persons to participate anyway.

NOTE: In the code and the User Interface, *Impersonation* and *Managed Participants* are the same thing.

== Enable / disable impersonations

Impersonations are only available when at least one authorization is enabled for the organization.
Indeed, they allow the system to search through a Verification system for an already existing participant, and to create
a participant without the need for an email address.

To enable an authorization, you need to have access to the xref:configure:system.adoc[System panel] or ask your instance implementer.

The different authorizations give you different possibilities:

* View impersonation logs only: When Identity documents, Code by postal letter, and/or Organization's census are enabled
* Impersonate existing and new users: Direct verification enabled, like example authorization or other custom direct authorizations.

NOTE: You can learn more regarding how to program your form authorization in
https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-verifications/README.md[Decidim-verification README].

== Manage impersonations

You can find all the participants of the platform, with:

* *Name*: name of the participant.
* *Status*: if the participant is impersonated/managed or not.

You can filter this list by clicking the "Filter" button and search for participants by their name.

After this data is checked by the system, it opens a session for the participant for 30 minutes.
A banner at the top of the page reminds the administrator that they are impersonating the participant, and the remaining time.

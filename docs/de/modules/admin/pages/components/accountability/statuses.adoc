= Statuses

== Understand the basics

A status represents the current state of a result.
For participants, statuses clearly indicate the state of each result, as status names are always shown with results.
For administrators, statuses help to keep result's progress updated, since each status can have a default progress percentage.

After configuring statuses, you can assign xref:admin:components/accountability/results.adoc[a status to a result].
Once a result have its status updated, its progress is automatically set to the default progress defined in the status.

Updating a result's status won't update the result history, but may xref:admin:features/participant_actions/notifications.adoc[send notifications].

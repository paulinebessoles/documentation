== Understand the basics

*The search engine* allows participants to perform searches across all of the platform’s content that can be indexed,
both generally and specifically, by searching within a specific participatory process or inside its components
(proposals, results, etc.), through advanced searches.

== How to find it?

The search engine is accessible in the instance header, next to your platform logo.

In the search bar, you can enter a word or just do an empty search to access the search results page.

The search engine searches for the entry in all the resources titles and descriptions.

You can also filter the search by clicking the resources types in the left.

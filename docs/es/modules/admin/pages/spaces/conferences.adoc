== Understand the basics

A conference is a collection of meetings arranged in a program, with a number of people invited as speakers, and other
information fields typical of large congresses or social events (registration, list of organizations that support or sponsor the
event, etc.) Una conferencia puede ser un evento relevante para una organización y sus miembros, o tendrá lugar como parte de un proceso
participativo o seguir una consulta.

In conferences, meetings components are displayed in a program form, with days and hours being listed like in an event program.

== Understand the basics

Newsletters may be sent out to inform participants of the latest news on the platform: launch of a new consultation, warning
before a closing date for votes, announcement of a result, monitoring of projects in progress, etc.
The newsletter is sent to any user of the site who has ticked the "Receive an occasional newsletter with relevant information"
box when they created their account, or later in their xref:admin:features/participant_actions/my_account.adoc[account] settings.

Alguns exemplos de quando você pode e deve enviar um boletim informativo são:

* When a new process could be interesting for all the citizens in a city,
for instance a Participatory Budgeting process.
* Quando há resultados publicados para um determinado processo.
* When an assembly has a important topic to discuss.
* Quando estiver programado um novo período de votação.
* When there's a new conference published.
* Etc.

=== How to find it?

Once you have written the newsletter, click the "Save and preview" button.

==== Send a test email

If you want to review the newsletter directly in your mailbox, click the "Send me a test email" button at the top right of the page.
You will receive the newsletter directly on the email address registered for your participant account.

==== Selecionar destinatários para entregar

If you want to only communicate about a given space or neighborhood, you can choose which participants you're sending the newsletter to.
To do so, click the "Select recipients to deliver" button.

NOTE: If you don't want to send your newsletter to a specific segment, select "Send to all users"

There, you can choose between sending the newsletter to:

* All confirmed users
* All confirmed users that have participated in any of the selected participatory spaces on the list
* All confirmed users that have followed any of the selected participatory spaces on the list
* All the participants that have selected an scope in their "My interests" settings on their account.

NOTE: Even if a participant has a confirmed account and is following a space, the system won't send them a newsletter email if they
haven't accepted it in their xref:admin:features/participant_actions/my_account#_notifications_settings.adoc[notifications] settings.

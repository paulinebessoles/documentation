== Understand the basics

A conference is a collection of meetings arranged in a program, with a number of people invited as speakers, and other
information fields typical of large congresses or social events (registration, list of organizations that support or sponsor the
event, etc.) Uma conferência pode ser um evento relevante para uma organização e seus membros ou entre como parte de um processo
participativo ou siga uma consulta.

In conferences, meetings components are displayed in a program form, with days and hours being listed like in an event program.

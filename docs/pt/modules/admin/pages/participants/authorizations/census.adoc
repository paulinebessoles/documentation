= Autorização do censo da organização

== Understand the basics

The Organization's census authorization allows administrators to upload a list of participant's emails, in order to allow this
list to perform specific actions on the plaform, like creating proposal in a specific space, etc.

== Configuração

O processo é o seguinte:

. Admins upload a CSV with the emails of the verified participants
. Participants go to their account and request to be verified
. Somente participantes com um e-mail nesse arquivo CSV podem ser verificados

NOTE: This authorization is too basic and you need more features related to CSV census imports?
Check all the CSV or file based authorizations in the https://decidim.org/modules/[Modules page].

=== 1. CSV upload

In the administrator panel, you can upload a CSV file by clicking on "Organization's census" in the "Participants" section.

After the CSV is imported then the administrator can see how many participants were imported. They can also delete this
imported census.

=== 2. Participant request

By going to the authorization section in its profile, or by clicking on the action button if this permission is requested,
a participant can request to be verified.

== Understand the basics

Proposals answers allow administrators or valuators to review a proposal and give it an official response, with associated statuses.
It allows then to filter the proposals by their statuses, read the answer that was given, and import the accepted proposals in the
xref:components/budgets.adoc[budgets] component.

NOTE: To learn more about valuators, refer to xref:admin:participants/admins.adoc#_valuators[Valuators administrators].

= Collaborative drafts

== Understand the basics

The collaborative draft feature allows participants to write proposals collaboratively, and have it written by multiple authors.

NOTE: Only the original author can approve or reject the collaboration requests, withdraw or publish the collaborative draft.

It has similarities with xref:components/proposals/special_configurations/amendments.adoc[Amendments] but the main difference
is that with collaborative drafts there is a need to trust other authors, as they can make changes to the original proposal
without approval by the original author, although the original author can decide if they promote the collaborative draft to a proposal.

== Configuração

To configure "Collaborative Drafts" in proposals, enable the "Collaborative Drafts enabled" setting in the component configuration form.

=== Create a draft

Once collaborative drafts are enabled, participants can see a "Access collaborative drafts" button in the proposals list.

Participants are then redirected on a list dedicated to collaborative drafts, where they can start creating new collaborative drafts.

By clicking the "New collaborative draft" button, they get redirected on the collaborative draft creation form.

Once the collaborative draft is created, its author can edit, withdraw, or publish the collaborative draft and approve or
reject eventual collaboration requests.

=== Collaborate on a draft

Other participants can then request to join the collaborative draft to make some changes and appear as authors.

When clicking the "Request access" button, a notification is sent to the original author.
They can then accept or reject the collaboration request on the collaborative draft right side bar.

Once a request is approved it can't be rejected anymore. Now the collaborative draft has multiple authors.

All authors can edit the collaborative draft by clicking in the "Edit collaborative draft" button.

The versions history for the draft and its successive changes is available by clicking the "See other versions" link at the bottom.

=== Publish a draft

Once the original author is satisfied with the collaborative draft, they can publish it by clicking the "Publish" button.

Once it's published, the draft becomes a proposal and appears on the proposal list and grid.

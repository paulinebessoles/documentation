== Understand the basics

The accountability component allows participants to know the status of a project's implementation and to follow its evolution.

This feature allows administrators to present a summary of the achievements decided upon in assemblies, during
participatory processes, or any other space. Administrators create Results they can then categorize and link to proposals, meetings, or
investment projects (for example, as part of a participatory budget).

Results can be closely monitored, with a history of modifications, a percentage of completion and milestones
indicating their progress. The results, milestones, and states can be updated manually through the administration panel or through a CSV.

In this documentation section, you can find how to configure and manage all of those items:

* xref:admin:components/accountability/results.adoc[Results]
* xref:admin:components/accountability/statuses.adoc[Statuses]
* xref:admin:components/accountability/milestone.adoc[Milestones]
* xref:admin:components/accountability/import.adoc[Import and export results]

=== Sub-results

A result can sometimes be the product of some other results.
For example, the results of "building 3 skate-parks in town" would use three sub-results, to monitor a detailed completion of the result.

Create a sub-result by clicking on the plus-sign from the accountability list.
To access the sub-results list, click on the main result title to get there.

= Authorizations

Authorizations allow to give specific participation rights to participants who have completed a verification process. 
This verification process can be direct, have multiple steps, be online or in-person. 

For instance you can configure that only participants who have verified themselves by their identity documents can vote on
proposals in a specific participatory process.

NOTE: Several authorizations are available by default, but you can also develop your own authorizations. 

== Enable / disable authorizations

To enable an authorization, you need to have access to the xref:configure:system.adoc[System panel] or ask your administrator. 
To understand more what are authorizations and how to configure them, please refer to the
xref:customize:authorizations.adoc[Authorizations section in the Customize Guide].

Participants can access, update, or delete their authorizations in their xref:admin:features/my_account/authorizations.adoc[account]. 

== Verification methods

Some of the available authorizations by default are:

* xref:admin:participants/authorizations/identity_documents.adoc[Identity documents]
* xref:admin:participants/authorizations/code_postal_letter.adoc[Code by postal letter]
* xref:admin:participants/authorizations/census.adoc[Organization's census]

If any of these authorizations are not useful for your needs, talk with your implementer to see other alternatives. Learn
more about xref:customize:authorizations.adoc[Authorizations in the Customize Guide section].

== Authorizations revocation

A default Decidim installation don't have verified participants.

From the moment some participants get verified with an authorization, administrators can revoke all the authorizations at once. 
Indeed, after some time, some of the verifications can be deprecated.  
For instance, identity documents expire after some time, or participants can move from a city. 
Then, an administrator can want to force participants to renew their verification information.

It's possible to revoke all the authorizations with "Revoke all," or to only revoke authorizations created before a given date.
Another possibility is to revoke only the verifications for xref:admin:participants/impersonations.adoc[impersonated participants].

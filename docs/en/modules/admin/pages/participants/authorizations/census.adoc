= Organization's census authorization

The process is as follows:

. Admins upload a CSV with the emails of the verified participants
. Participants go to their account and request to be verified
. Only participants with an email in that CSV file can get verified

NOTE: This authorization is too basic and you need more features related to CSV census imports?
Check all the CSV or file based authorizations in the https://decidim.org/modules/[Modules page].

== 1. CSV upload

In the administrator panel, you can upload a CSV file by clicking on "Organization's census" in the "Participants" section.

imported census.

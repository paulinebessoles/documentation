= Code by postal letter authorization

This authorization allows a participant to request for a verification code to be sent to an address, to confirm that they
live or work in this place. They then need to fill the received code in the platform.

NOTE: If you don't want to use this authorization, we advice you to disable it in the xref:admin:system.adoc[system panel].

The process is:

. Participant request a verification code to be sent to an address.
. An administrator sends the letter to their address with the verification code.
. An administrator marks the letter as sent.
. Once you mark the letter as sent, the participant is able to introduce the code.
. If this code matchs, then they get verified.

== 1. Verification code request

By going to the authorization section in its profile, or by clicking on the action button if this permission is requested,
a participant can see the form requesting their full address.

If they try to edit it, they will see this message:

This is because the letter could be in the process of being sent. If this needs to be corrected, then the participant needs
to contact a platform administrator.

== 2. Administrator review

In the admin panel, the administrator can review the request by going to the "Code by postal letter" in the "Participants" section.

Here they can see the verification code and can send it to the participant by postal letter. After the code is sent they can mark it
as such with the icon image:icons/action_verify.png[Mark as sent]. It'll also show when the letter was sent.

== 3. Participant validate the code

After the participant has received the code, they can go to their account settings and click in the "Code by postal letter"
verfication method.

Then they can fill the form with the code they received.

== 4. Code match

If the verification code matches, then the participant will see the message "Congratulations. You've been successfully verified".

On the other hand, if the verification code doesn't match, then the participant will see the message "Your verification
code doesn't match ours. Please double-check the letter we sent to you."

After is verified, as with other verifications, they can see it in their account settings.

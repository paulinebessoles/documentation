= Components

== Understand the basics

Through components an administrator can enable and configure different participatory mechanisms.
All components are available in all the different xref:admin:spaces.adoc[spaces].

When you create a participatory space, by default, it won't have any component in it.

== Configuration

Components are accessible in each xref:admin:spaces.adoc[space], through the administration secondary navigation bar.

To create a component, click the "Add component" button and select the type of component you want to create.

Once you start publishing components, participants see links to the different components appear in the space "Main data" 
content block in the landing page, in the general search engine, and in the dedicated homepage content blocks.

You can find all the components of the space on the list, with:

* *Component name*: title of the component, chosen at its creation and editable. 
* *Component type*: type of component. 
* *Component scope*: the xref:admin:scopes.adoc[scope] of the component.

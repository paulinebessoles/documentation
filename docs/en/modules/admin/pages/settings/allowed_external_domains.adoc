As means to protect against spam, and increase the security on your instance, Decidim can identify any links that direct 
to an external webpage, and add the following alert pop-up after the user clicks it:

It warns participants that they're leaving your instance. 

== Allow an external domains

There may be some websites redirection for which you don't want this feature enabled. 
For example, if your site is deployed at a URL like `+decidim.example.org+` and you want every `+example.org+` URLs 
to omit this alert message, you can configure this by adding your URL, and as many as you want, in the Allowed external domains page.

To do so, click the "Add to allowed list" button and enter the website URL you want to authorize.

When clicking on a URL to those domains, participants won't see the alert message.

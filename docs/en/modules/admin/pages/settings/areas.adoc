= Areas

include::partial$deprecated.adoc[]

Areas are all the sectors that an organization can have.

Areas are pretty similar to xref:admin:settings/scopes.adoc[scopes], meaning that they're a way of allowing a 
better navigation and filtering in the spaces and components.

You can read more information about the history of Areas in 
this https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/3540#issuecomment-427324532[GitHub comment].

= Global moderations

== Understand the basics

The *Global moderations*Â function allows you to moderate different kind of contents and
ensure that the dialog in your platform is democratic and constructive. 
It also allows managing participants who infringe the rules of the platform.

NOTE: Looking for how to report participants or content? See xref:moderations/reported_users.adoc[Reported participants] and xref:moderations/reported_content.adoc[Reported content].

For instance, in the case of https://www.decidim.barcelona/[Decidim Barcelona],
the https://www.decidim.barcelona/pages/terms-and-conditions[Terms of Service] says:

> It is not allowed to add any illegal or unauthorized content to the site, such
as information with the following features:
>
> * be it false or misleading;
> * to infringe any law of the City Council or any third party, such as copyright,
trademarks or other intellectual and industrial property rights or related rights;
> * attacking the privacy of a third party, such as publishing personal details
of participants, such as name, address, phone number, email, photos or any other
personal information;
> * containing viruses, Trojans, robots or other programs that may harm the website
or the City Hall systems, or the website or system of any third party, or which

> * which has the character of message chain, pyramidal game or random game;
> * for commercial purposes, such as publishing job offers or ads;
> * that it is not in keeping with public decency; consequently, content must not
incite hatred, discriminate, threaten, provoke, have no sexual, violent, coarse or
offensive meaning or character;

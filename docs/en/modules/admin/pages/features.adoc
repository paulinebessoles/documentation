== Understand the basics

Decidim is mainly organized around xref:admin:spaces.adoc[Spaces] and xref:admin:components.adoc[Components], but also offers
a lot of other features, to enable administrators to keep the participants engaged, to encourage the collaboration and the 
participation on the platform, etc. 

For the readability of this documentation, they are divided in four different sections: 

. *xref:admin:features/search.adoc[Search] engine*
. *xref:admin:features/social_features.adoc[Social features]*
. *xref:admin:features/transparency_features.adoc[Transparency features]*
. *xref:admin:features/participants_actions.adoc[Participant account and actions]*

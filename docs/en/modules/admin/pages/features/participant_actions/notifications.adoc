= Notifications

== Understand the basics

Notifications allow participants to keep up to date with the platform's latest news,  spaces, content, participants they follow, etc.
Most actions on the platform generate notifications.

Participants can manage their notification preferences in their xref:admin:features/participant_actions/my_account.adoc[account].

=== How to find it?

As a signed in participant, you can access your notifications from two places:

. Click your avatar in the header, and then click the "Notifications" menu item
. Click the "Notifications" link in the footer, in the "My account" section

If there are notifications, the participant sees a small badge next to their avatar, and in the dropdown menu.

When there are no notifications, or the participant marked all the notifications as read, a message is displayed indicating that there are no new notifications.

=== Notifications list

Below is an exhaustive list of actions that trigger notifications to participants. Participants are divided into three categories: affected users, followers, and administrators.

NOTE: Affected users depend on the notification context. For instance, it could be the author of moderated content, a user earns a badge, a user has been mentioned, etc, depending on the user's interaction with the spaces and other users on the platform.

= My public profile

== Understand the basics

Every participant has a public profile that shows details about them and their activity on the instance.
This profile page is accessible to all participants and visitors. 

== How to find it?

To see a participant public profile, click directly in their avatar or their user name in the participant tool-tip.

As a signed in participant, you can access your public profile from two places:

. Click in your avatar in the header, and then click in the "My public profile" menu item
. Click in the "My public profile" link in the footer, in the "My account" section

=== Badges

The public profile's badges shows which badges the participant has accumulated and what their current level is for each badge.

More information about badges is available on the xref:admin:features/social_features/badges.adoc[Badges feature page].

=== Follows

The follows section contains a list of participants and groups the participant is currently following. 
By following another participant or a group on the platform, the participant receives notifications about the activity 
done by those participants or groups on the platform. Some participants may also require that they need to be following 
a participant before they can exchange private messages with each other.

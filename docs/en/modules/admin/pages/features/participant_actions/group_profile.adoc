= Groups profiles

== Understand the basics

As a participant, I might want to create a user group for my association, my company, my club, etc. 
If an administrator verifies that you are entitled to represent this group, then you are able to participate in the instance in the 
name of the group. 

NOTE: The group creation option is only available when groups are enabled for the organization. 
You can ask an administrator of the platform or enable it from the xref:admin:configuration.adoc[Configuration] panel.

== Create a group

To create a group, click the "Create group" button in your public profile.

The user group is visible on the platform as soon as you create it. After its creation, you are redirected to the 
user group profile page. 

== Manage a group

After a group has been created, it's possible to invite participants to become members of the group. 
After a participant has accepted to be part of this group then they can become an admin.

The actions that can be done by a user group administrator are:

* Edit group profile
* Manage members
* Manage admins
* Invite participant
* Leave group

==== Participate as a group

The interest of having an administrator verify the user group is that you can then participate to the platform as a group, 
and create debate, proposal, meetings, comments, etc. 

NOTE: Only user group administrators are authorized to participate in name of the group. 

Administrators of the user group can for example comment in the name of their group.

They can also choose to endorse a debate or a proposal in the name of their group and / or in their own name.

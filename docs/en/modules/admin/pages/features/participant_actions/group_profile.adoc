== Understand the basics

=== Participate as a group

NOTE: For user group administrators to be able to participate as a group, an administrator of the instance must have verified it. 

The interest of having an administrator verify the user group is that you can then participate to the platform as a group, 
and create debates, proposals, meetings, comments, etc. 

Administrators of the user group can for example comment in the name of their group.

They can also choose to endorse a debate or a proposal in the name of their group and / or in their own name.

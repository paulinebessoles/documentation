= Endorsements

== Understand the basics

Through endorsements, participants can publicly show that they want to support a particular content, like a proposal, a debate, etc. 
Administrators can enable endorsements by step in a given participatory process, and they can also define permissions with authorizations.

NOTE: Endorsements are also called "Likes" in the participant interface.

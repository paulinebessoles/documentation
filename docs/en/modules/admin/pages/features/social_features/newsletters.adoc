= Newsletters

== Understand the basics

Newsletters may be sent out to inform participants of the latest news on the platform: launch of a new consultation, warning 
before a closing date for votes, announcement of a result, monitoring of projects in progress, etc. 
The newsletter is sent to any user of the site who has ticked the "Receive an occasional newsletter with relevant information"
box when they created their account, or later in their xref:admin:features/participant_actions/my_account.adoc[account] settings.

Some examples of when you can and should sent a newsletter are:

* When a new process could be interesting for all the citizens in a city,
for instance a Participatory Budgeting process.
* When there are the results published for a given process.
* When an assembly has a important topic to discuss.
* When there's a new voting planned.
* When there's a new conference published.
* Etc. 

== Configuration

To access the Newsletters panel, go in the administration panel and click the "Newsletters" item in the administration navigation bar.

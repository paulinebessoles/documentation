== Understand the basics

Badges are recognitions of the participant actions and progress on the platform. As participants start discovering, participating,
and interacting, they earn different badges. Here is the list of badges and some ways participants can earn them.

It's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification[gamification] mechanism to improve the engagement of the participants in a ludic way.

The badges a participant has are visible in their public profile.

When a participant earns a badge they receive a notification.

the participants receive the first level badge when they have 1 follower, the second level at 15 followers, the third level at 30 followers,
the fourth level at 60 and the fifth level at 100.

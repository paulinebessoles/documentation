= Fingerprint

== Understand the basics

Although the platform should show the xref:admin:features/versions.adoc[Versions] for almost all of the contents, it'd still be possible 
for a system administrator to manipulate the content by editing the database directly.

As mitigation for this risk, the platform shows a fingerprint for some important fields, for instance, a proposal body and title.

Its goal is to provide a way to give an informal "receipt" to a participant so they can detect tampering. A fingerprint is
a hashed representation of the content. It's useful to ensure the content hasn't been tampered with, as a single modification
would result in a totally different value. It's calculated using a *SHA256 hashing algorithm*. In order to replicate it
yourself, you can use a http://www.md5calc.com/sha256[MD5 calculator online] and copy-paste the source data.

== Check fingerprint

. Go to the content for which you want to verify the fingerprint
. Click in the "Check fingerprint" link at the bottom of the page
. Copy the source field value
. Go to a MD5 calculator online (External link) and copy-paste the source data
. Check that fingerprint are the same

It's also possible to verify the fingerprint with other tools, such as the sha256sum command line tool.

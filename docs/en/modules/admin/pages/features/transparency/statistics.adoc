= Statistics

== Understand the basics

Decidim provides general statistics about the whole platform and different participatory spaces can also provide statistics related to that participatory space only.
These are generic numbers that indicate the website activity and may also encourage other people to join the platform as they see it being popular.

=== How to find it?

==== Statistics

The homepage configuration allows administrators to enable a statistics content block to be displayed on the homepage.

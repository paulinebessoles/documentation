= Versions

== Understand the basics

The versions feature allows a visitor to see the evolution of the different versions of resources that can be edited,
like proposals or results.

With versions it's possible to see who made changes to a content, when the change has been made and exactly what has changed.

== How to find it?

. Go to the content for which you want to review the different versions. 
. Click in the "see other versions" link in the bottom of the page. 
. From there you can change the visualisation of the version differences, and review all past versions.

It's possible to view the diffs of the versions in two formats: side by side or unified. In case that the contents are
in HTML then it's also possible to see the diff un-escaped and escaped, and see the full HTML code.

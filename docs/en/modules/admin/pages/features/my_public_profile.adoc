== Understand the basics

Every participant has a public profile that shows details about them and their activity on the instance.
This profile page is accessible to all participants and visitors. 

== How to find it?

To see a participant public profile, click directly in their avatar or their user name in the participant tool-tip.

== Profile tabs

There, you'll find different tabs.

NOTE: You might not see the Badges and the Groups tab if you didn't enable them in the xref:admin:configuration.adoc[Configuration] panel.

=== Activity

This tab displays all the activity of the participant, starting with the most recent content.

=== Badges

The public profile's badges shows which badges the participant has accumulated and what their current level is for each badge.

=== Follows

The follows section contains a list of participants and groups the participant is currently following. 
By following another participant or a group on the platform, the participant receives notifications about the activity 
done by those participants or groups on the platform. Some participants may also require that they need to be following 
a participant before they can exchange private messages with each other.

The user group is visible on the platform as soon as you create it. After its creation, you are redirected to the 
user group profile page. 

==== Manage a group

After a group has been created, it's possible to invite participants to become members of the group. 
After a participant has accepted to be part of this group then they can become an admin.

The actions that can be done by a user group administrator are:

* Edit group profile
* Manage members
* Manage admins
* Invite participant
* Leave group

User groups profiles pages display: 

* Members: Members of the groups, and who are the administrators. 
* Badges: User group badges. 
* Followers: Participants can also follow user groups. 

You can also have Conversations as a group. This is in the group profile page:

==== Participate as a group

The interest of having an administrator verify the user group is that you can then participate to the platform as a group, 
and create debate, proposal, meetings, comments, etc. 

NOTE: Only user group administrators are authorized to participate in name of the group. 

Administrators of the user group can for example comment in the name of their group.

They can also choose to endorse a debate or a proposal in the name of their group and / or in their own name.

= Amendments

== Understand the basics

With the amendment feature, participants can propose changes to an existing proposals, and therefore collaborate with other.

It's useful to propose improvements or corrections, specially when redacting laws or norms with the
xref:components/proposals/special_configurations/participatory_texts.adoc[Participatory Texts] feature.

It has similarities with xref:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts.adoc[Collaborative Drafts], but the main difference
is that with amendments there is no need to trust the other authors intentions, as every change is reviewed and must be
approved by the author of the original proposal.

== Create an amendment

Let's imagine a participant sees another participant's proposal, and wants to enhance it. 
When amendments are enabled, they can click the "Amend" button on the proposal page.

They can then make the changes in the "Create amendment draft" form, directly on the original text.

The participant can then preview their amendment before publishing it.

== Review an amendment

All the participants can see the amendment drafts made on proposals, on the proposal page. 
Amendments also appear as proposals in the proposal list and grid and can be filtered by participants.

The author of the amended proposal receives a notification to go review the amendment.

The author can then accept or reject the amendment. By clicking on the "Accept" button, they are redirected to the amendment review page.

Once the amendment is approved, the original proposal is updated, and the fact that it was amended appear on the proposal.

The versions history for the proposal and its successive amendments is available by clicking the "See other versions" link at the bottom. 

== Promote an amendment

If a proposal is rejected and the "Amendment promotion enabled" is enabled, then the amendment author can promote it to create
 a new proposal.

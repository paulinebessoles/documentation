= Participatory texts

== Understand the basics

This feature allows participants to navigate in the proposals like in a text, rather than a list or a grid. 
It can be useful for discussing norms, plans, or other kinds of texts.

Every paragraph is split into a proposal, so it's possible to discuss it in a more granular way.

== Configuration

To configure "Participatory texts" in proposals, enable the "Participatory texts enabled" setting in the component configuration form.

easier to see the formatting. link:{attachmentsdir}/participatory_text.md[Download the example MD participatory text] for help.

Click the "Upload document" button to see the participatory text preview. 

== Preview the document

Thanks to the preview, you can review if the document is correctly imported, and divided as you want it to be. 

Depending on the preview, you can:

* Discard: if you're not satisfied and want to reformat your document to start the import again. 
* Save draft: if you're satisfied with the result, but still wants to make some modifications. 
* Publish document: if you're ready to see how the text is like in the user interface. 

Once you published the document, all sections are presented as proposals in the proposal management panel.

Finally, you can publish the proposal component, for the participatory text to be visible by participants. 

NOTE: This feature could break existing proposals, so if there is any proposal it can't work, and a warning message is displayed:

====
Cannot interact with this setting if there are existing proposals. Please, create a new `Proposals component` if you want
to enable this feature or discard all imported proposals in the `Participatory Texts` menu if you want to disable it.
====

== Frontend

Once the document is imported and the proposals component published, participants are able to navigate the participatory text.

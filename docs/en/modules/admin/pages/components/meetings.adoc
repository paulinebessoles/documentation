= Meetings

== Understand the basics

The Meetings component allows administrators to organize, advertise, deal with registration and wrap up in-person or online meetings. 
Depending on the component configuration, meetings can be created only by administrators, or also by participants. 

In this documentation section, you can find how to configure and manage all of those items:

* xref:admin:components/meetings/meetings.adoc[Meetings creation]: Create official or participant meetings. 
* xref:admin:components/meetings/registrations.adoc[Registrations]: Manage how participants can register to attend the meetings.
* xref:admin:components/meetings/agenda.adoc[Agenda]: Announce the meetings topics to be discussed.
* xref:admin:components/meetings/polls.adoc[Polls]: Enable quick voting during an online meeting.
* xref:admin:components/meetings/close.adoc[Close]: Add the final report and minutes of the meeting.

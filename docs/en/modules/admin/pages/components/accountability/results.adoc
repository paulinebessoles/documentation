= Accountability management

== Understand the basics

Results are the entities that constitute the accountability component. They can be linked to proposals, projects, meetings, and have
statuses, and dates assigned.

Administrators can also create sub-results, to detail the elements needed for a result implementation.

== Create a result

To start creating results, click on the component title in the navigation bar or in the component list, or click on the
image:icons/action_edit.png[Manage component icon] icon on the components list.

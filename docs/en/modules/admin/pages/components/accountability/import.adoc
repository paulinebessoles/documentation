We recommend that you follow these steps:

. Create the xref:_statuses[Statuses] for the Results that you want to add
. Create at least one xref:_new_result[Result] manually through this Admin panel before using Import, for having a better understanding of
the format and what you'll need to fill out.
. Download the xref:_export_all[Export with CSV format]
. Make the changes locally. You can only change the following columns of the CSV:
** category/id: ID for the Category
** scope/id: ID for the Scope
** parent/id: ID of the parent (for related Results). Optional
** title/I18N: Title on X language
** description/I18N: Description on X language
** start_date: date when the result starts execution (format YYYY-MM-DD)
** end_date: date when the result ends execution (format YYYY-MM-DD)
** status/id: ID of the Status for this result
** progress: Percentage (from 0 to 100) of the execution
** proposals_ids: internal ID of the related proposals (separated with a comma). It gets automatically converted to proposal_url

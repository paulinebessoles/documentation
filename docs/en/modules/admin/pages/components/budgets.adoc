= Budgets

== Understand the basics

The Budgets component allows participants to vote by selecting projects of their choosing. Administrators can decide the voting rules, 
to make participants select a defined number of projects, or vote for as many project they want until reaching a certain amount.

Administrators have several options for the voting workflow and for the voting rules.

After the voting has finished, an administrator need to:

. Change the Voting configuration for the Budget component to "Voting finished"
. Go in the projects list and view the results
. On the projects that have been selected, go in each project, edit it and tick the "Selected for implementation" checkbox.

Then, the projects list shows all the project that have been selected for implementation.

A filter is also displayed for participants to see which projects have been selected, and find the ones that weren't selected.

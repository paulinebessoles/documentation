= Pages

== Understand the basics

The Page component allows people to get information about a space. Administrators can fill a page with informational content, 
images, links, to inform and update the participants. 

It's similar to the general xref:admin:pages.adoc[Pages], the main difference being that this component allows to define pages inside
a participatory space, and not in the Help section.

== Configuration

To create a Page component, first go in the xref:admin:spaces.adoc[participatory space] where you want to create it.

Then:

. Click on the "Components" item in the secondary menu
. Click the "Add component" button
. Select "Page"
. Fill the component creation form

You can still update this form and the configuration after creating the component, by clicking the 
image:icons/action_configure.png[Configure icon] icon in the components list.

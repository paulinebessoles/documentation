== Understand the basics

Once a meeting is over, the meeting author can close it. This allows to adds the meeting minutes, the notes
that gives a summary on what was discussed during the meeting, the agreements reached, decisions made, etc.

This allows to bring transparency to the meeting and also serves as a record of the different meetings.

It's also possible to add other kind of metadata to the meeting, such as the organizations who attended, how many attendees
and contributions there were, and what proposals were discussed.

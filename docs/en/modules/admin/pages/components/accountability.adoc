= Accountability

== Understand the basics

The Accountability component allows participants to know the status of a project's implementation and to follow its evolution.

This feature allows administrators to present a summary of the achievements decided upon in assemblies, during 
participatory processes, or any other space. Administrators create Results they can then categorize and link to proposals, meetings, or 
investment projects (for example, as part of a participatory budget).

Results can be closely monitored, with a history of modifications saved, and percentages of completion and milestones 
indicating their progress. The results, projects, and states can be updated manually through the administration panel or through a CSV.

In this documentation section, you can find how to configure and manage all of those items:

* xref:admin:components/accountability/results.adoc[Results]
* xref:admin:components/accountability/statuses.adoc[Statuses]
* xref:admin:components/accountability/timeline.adoc[Project evolution]

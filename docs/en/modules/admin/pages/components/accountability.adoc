= Accountability

== Understand the basics

The Accountability component allows administrators to present a summary of the achievements decided upon in assemblies, during 
participatory processes, or any other space. Administrators create Results they can then categorize and link to proposals, meetings, or 
investment projects (for example, as part of a participatory budget). 

Results are closely monitored, with a history of modifications saved, and percentages of completion and milestones 
indicating their progress. The results, projects, and states can be updated manually through the administration panel or through a CSV.

The results can be linked to projects and decomposed into sub-results. Administrators can define implementation status,
ranging from 0% to 100%.

== Configure

To create an Accountability component, first go in the xref:admin:spaces.adoc[participatory space] where you want to create it.

You can still update this form and the configuration after creating the component, by clicking the

the format and what you'll need to fill out.

. Make the changes locally. You can only change the following columns of the CSV:
** category/id: ID for the Category

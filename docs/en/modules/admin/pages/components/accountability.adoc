= Accountability

== Understand the basics

The Accountability component allows to view the progress of a project implementation. 
It allows to create results in a participatory space, and to keep track of the decisions made on the platform,
and to relate them to the proposals and meetings that helped to shape them.

The results can be linked to projects or decomposed into sub-results. Administrators can define implementation status,
ranging from 0% to 100%. The results, projects, and states can be updated manually through the administration panel or through a CSV.

== Examples

You can see examples of the Accountability component in the 
https://www.decidim.barcelona/processes/pam/f/8/[2016-2019 Municipal Action Plan in Decidim Barcelona].

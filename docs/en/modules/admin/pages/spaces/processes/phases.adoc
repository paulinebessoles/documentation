= Phases

== Understand the basics

A participatory process is a sequence of phases ordered in time. Depending on which phase of the process timeline you
are, then you can enable and configure the features you need for each phase.

Ideally, the Phases of a Participatory Process are always the same and are not changed, so participants can know what are
the rules and time frame and can organize to know when it'd be best for them to participate in this process.

For example, the standard structure of a participatory process could be as follows:

. Presentation
. Diagnosis
. Proposal creation and debate
. Proposals prioritization
. Proposals evaluation
. Monitoring

Participants can find the link to different phases of a participatory process in the "Phase and duration" landing page content block, 
when it's enabled by an administrator in the process xref:admin:spaces/processes/landing_page.adoc[Landing page].

When clicking on the link for the active phase, they can see the full description and explanation of the phases in a pop-up.

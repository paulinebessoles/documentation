= Process groups

== Understand the basics

A group of processes can be useful for subdividing large participatory processes into sub-processes according to a criteria.
It can also allow administrators to organize an instance with a lot of processes, to gather together the ones related to a 
specific type of process, or a specific scope, like participatory budgeting annual editions, mobility planning processes, etc. 

== Manage process groups

To access the process group management page, click the "Process groups" tab in the processes index page.

This means that you can enable different sections of the landing page and configure some of these sections.

To configure a process group landing page, when editing the process group, click the "Manage" button in the top right of the page, 
and click the "Landing page" menu item.

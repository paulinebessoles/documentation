= Process types

== Understand the basics

In some cases it is necessary to organize participatory processes by more than just xref:spaces/processes/groups.adoc[Process Groups]. 
This is where process types can be useful, and add a layer of categorization. 
Participants are then able to filter processes by the process types you created. 

NOTE: Process types work similarly to xref:admin:spaces/assemblies.adoc#_assemblies_types[Assembly types].

== Manage process types

To access the process types list, click the "Manage" button on the top right of the page, and click the "Process type" menu item.

== Add process type to a process

To relate processes to process types, in the edition page of a process, select the process type under the section labelled Other.

== Filter by process types

If there is at least one process type defined and related to a process, a filter is displayed at the left of the processes list 
in the participant interface, allowing filtering of Processes.

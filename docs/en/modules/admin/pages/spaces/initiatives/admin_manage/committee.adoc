== Understand the basics

NOTE: Promoter's committee explanation is available on xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/author_manage/committee.adoc[Promoter’s committee].

Committee members might be necessary, depending on the rules set for the initiative types. 
Participants can manage them from their initiative edition form, but administrators can also access the list of 
committee members.

== Manage committee members

To access the committee members list, click in the secondary navigation panel on the "Committee members" item.

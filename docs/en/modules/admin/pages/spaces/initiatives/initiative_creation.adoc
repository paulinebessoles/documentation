== 1. Create an initiative

This action is done by **the author**. The author is a participant that creates the initiative. Depending on how the initiatives module is configured in the initializer or how the initiative type is configured, it may need to ask for authorization, or it will even not show the "New initiative" button.

For creating an initiative, a participant must click in the "New initiative" button. Then they will have a wizard with multiple steps:


=== 1.1 Choose the initiative type

=== 1.2 Add title and description

=== 1.3 [Optional] Similarity comparison

Checks the rest of the initiatives if there are other similar initiatives. If there are, the system will show them before continuing. This is a way to avoid duplicates.

=== 1.4 Finish

=== Actions after it was created

After the initiative was created, a participant can see the initiative page, but until the initiative is reviewed and accepted by an administrator, through the technical validation, it will not be published and visible for all the participants.

In the sidebar a participant can make some actions: Edit, Print and Send to technical validation.

== 2. Send initiative to technical validation

This action is done by **the author**.

After it has been reviewed by the author, it can be sent to "Technical validation", but it depends in the configuration of the initiative type, in whether the options "Enable promoting committee" and "Minimum of committee members" are configured.

=== Promoter's committee

An initiative type can optionally be supported by a promoter's committee, with a minimum number of committee members. Once the user has created the initiative and before it can be sent for technical validation they need to invite committee members to promote it.

When the user has created the initiative they will be given a link to share with possible committee members, which will look something like `/initiatives/.../committee_requests/new`

When a prospective committee member opens the link, they can click a button which allows them to request to be part of the committee. The initiative author then needs to approve each request. The author can approve them by clicking on the "Edit" button of their initiative at the bottom of the form they can approve or reject committee members.

The initiative cannot be sent to technical validation until it meets the minimum number of committee members required. You can find the invitation link in the edit form.

Share the invitation link with the people you'd like to have on your committee.

image:initiative_commitee_members_ask.png[Initiative promotor committee: edit screen]

The people invited with the link will be able to read the initiative and ask to be part of the committee.

image:initiative_commitee_members_sent.png[Initiative promotor committee: edit screen]

The request is sent and the author can then and accept or refuse it in the initiative edit form.

image:initiative_commitee_members_send_to_technical_true.png[Initiative promotor committee: edit screen]

Once enough people have joined the promoter committee the initiative author can send it for
technical validation.

== 3. Publish an initiative

This action is done by **an administrator**.

After the initiative was sent to technical validation by a participant, an administrator can view all the initiatives in the admin panel and make some corrections.

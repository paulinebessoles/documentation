= Initiative creation

== Understand the basics

Once you configured the xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/types.adoc[initiatives types and scopes], you should be able to access the initiative space in the user interface.

Participants are now able to create initiatives.
Depending on how the initiatives module is configured in the initializer or how the initiative type is configured, it may need to ask for an authorization.

== Initiative creation steps

To start creating an initiative, the participant must click in the "New initiative" button.
Depending on the configuration of your instance, they have to pass different steps before being able to send their initiative to technical validation, where it gets reviewed 
by an administrator before being published and starting collecting signatures. 

=== Initiative type choice

If the instance has multiple initiative types, then the first step is the choice of the initiative type.

If there is only one initiative type configured, this step is automatically skipped.

=== Similarity comparison

Can be disabled by your organization implementer.
Checks the rest of the initiatives if there are other similar initiatives. If there are, the system shows them before continuing. 
This is a way to avoid duplicates and encourage participants to support other similar initiatives.

=== Promoter committee

If promoter committee is enabled for this initiative type, this step allows participants to understand what they need to do before being able to send their initiative for publication.

See the xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/author_manage/committee.adoc[Promoting committee] article for more information.

=== Finish

The finish step announce the initiative creation to the participant, and shows them different buttons depending if they still need to find promoting committee members.

If the initiative type doesn't require multiple committee members, participants can directly send their initiative to technical validation. 

NOTE: The initiative won't be publicly visible on the initiatives list until reviewed and published by an administrator.

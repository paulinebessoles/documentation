=== New initiative type form

In the first place, you will have to configure the various forms of initiatives. This could be specified in a regulation (like a municipal normative or state law), specifying the number of signatures required for processing the various types of initiatives. For example, an initiative for incorporating one or several items into the Municipal Council’s agenda evidently requires fewer signatures than another initiative for promoting a binding consultation.

== 0. Initiative setup

How initiatives work depends on two things: how the initiative module is configured through the xref:admin:initiatives_initializer.adoc[initializer] (in code) and how the initiative type is configured in the administration panel.

Regarding initiatives type, **an administrator** needs to define one. For Initiatives to work on an organization there must be at least one initiative type created and configured with at least one initiative type scope. If there's only one type then the participant will not get the possibility to choose the initiative type, this step will be skipped in the initiative creation wizard.

Some real examples from the city of Barcelona are:

* To add an item to the Municipal Council or Districts agendas
* To perform a participatory process
* To create a new assembly
* To approve or modify a regulation
* To request the holding of a citizen consultation
* To call for assemblies (neighborhood councils or public audiences)

= Initiative types

== Understand the basics

Initiative types are the main framework for initiatives, as they allow administrators to define the different forms initiatives 
can take, as well as the specific rules and number of signatures needed for each type of initiatives. 

For example, your organization could allow participants to:

* propose a new regulation
* open a working group or a committee
* modify an existing regulation
* calls for an extraordinary general assembly
* adding items to a city council agenda

In general, such mechanisms are specified in an internal regulation (like a municipal normative or state law), specifying 
the number of signatures required. 

You need to create at least *one initiative type* and *one initiative type scope* to enable participants to publish initiatives. 
If you create several initiative types, then participants can choose which type their initiative belongs to. 

== Create an initiative type

To create an initiative type, click the "Manage" button in the top right of the page, then the "Initiative types" menu item.

An initiative type must have associated scopes to allow participants to create initiatives. 
Indeed, they allow to associate a scope with a number of signatures, and therefore to have multiple signatures threshold for a same initiative type. 

On the initiative type form, scroll down to find a new section called "Scopes for the initiative type" and a button.

= Manage initiatives

== Understand the basics

When a participant creates an initiative, it doesn't only create a resource like a proposal, it creates a whole space,
allowing administrators to manage in the administration: 

* xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/admin_manage/committee.adoc[Committee members]
* xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/admin_manage/components.adoc[Components]
* xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/admin_manage/attachments.adoc[Attachments]
* xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/admin_manage/moderations.adoc[Moderations]
* xref:admin:spaces/initiatives/admin_manage/answer.adoc[Answer an initiative]

NOTE: If you didn't configure it, once an initiative is created, it gets the Meetings and Page component enabled by
default. Ask your instance implementer to modify this parameter if you don't need it, or want other components enabled by default.

== Manage initiatives

After the initiative was sent to technical validation by a participant, an administrator can view all the initiatives in the administration panel.

You can find all the processes on this list with:

* *ID*: identification number of the initiative.
* *Initiatives*: title of the initiative. 
* *Signatures*: sum of online and in-person signatures.
* *Created at*: date of creation of the initiative. 
* *Published at*: date of publication of the initiative. 

You can filter and sort this list by clicking the "Filter" button and the columns headers. 
You can also search for initiatives by their title in the search bar.

== Edit an initiative

When clicking the "Edit" button or the initiative title on the initiative list in administration, the administrator is 
redirected to the initiative edit form, and can see that the secondary navigation bar on the left also allows to manage 
the initiative committee members, its components, attachments and reported content.

On the edition form, the administrator can review and modify the initiative's title, description, scope, area, etc.
They can also send the initiative to technical validation. 

== Publish an initiative

Once an initiative is sent to technical validation, the administrator can decide to publish it or discard it. 
To publish an initiative in technical validation, go on the initiative edition page and click the "Publish" button. 

== Export signatures

After the initiative started to get signatures, administrators can export the signatures in the initiative edit form, in CSV or in .pdf.

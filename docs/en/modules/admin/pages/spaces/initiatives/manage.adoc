= Manage initiatives

== Understand the basics

Initiatives pass through different steps, and follow a specific life-cycle:

* *Created*: The author created the initiative, it's only visible by author, promoter committee members and administrators.
* *Technical validation*: The initiative is ready for review by an administrator.
* *Published*: An administrator reviewed the initiative and published it. 
* *Expired*: If no administrator published it before a time configured in the initiative initializer. 
* *Discarded*: If the initiative didn't pass the review by an administrator. 
* *Rejected*: If the initiative didn't receive enough signatures in the signature collection period.
* *Accepted*: If the initiative received enough signatures in the signature collection period.

@startuml
:Created;
:Technical validation;
if (has passed the maximum validation time?) then (yes)
  #pink:Expired;
  kill;
elseif (validated?) then (no)
  #pink:Discarded;
  kill;
else (yes)
  #palegreen:Published;
  if (enough signatures?) then (no)
    #pink:Rejected
    (not enough signatures);
    kill;
  else (yes)
    #palegreen:Accepted
    (enough signatures);
    stop;
  endif;
endif

Finally, these are all the relevant settings in every moment in the initiatives life cycle:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
(*) --> "Create a new initiative"
if "Has only one type?" then
--> [Yes] "Fill initiative form"
else
--> [No] "Select initiative type"
--> "Fill initiative form"
Endif
partition Created {
  if "Is the User a UserGroup?" then
  --> [Yes] "Send to Technical Validation"
  else
  --> [No] Collect the minimum number of committee members
  --> "Send to Technical Validation"
  Endif
}
partition Validating {
  if "Has passed the maximum time for validation (60 days by default)?" then
    --> [Yes] "Expired"
  else
    --> [No] if "Is accepted by an administrator?" then
      --> [No] "Discarded"
      else
      --> [Yes] "Publish"
      endIf
  endIf
}
partition Published {
  --> "Signature process"
  if "Has passed the configured time window for validation (60 days by default)?"
    --> [Yes] "Expired"
  else
    --> [No] Export PDF to signatures
    --> Check signatures with offline signatures for duplicates (if the Initiative has them)
    --> if "Has the initiative get the number of signatures required?" then
      --> [No] Rejected
    else
      --> [Yes] Accepted
    endIf
  endIf
}
--> (*)

== Initiatives management

After the initiative was sent to technical validation by a participant, an administrator can view all the initiatives in the administration panel.

image::spaces/initiatives/initiative_admin_list.png[Admin initiatives list]

You can find all the processes on this list with:

* *ID*: identification number of the initiative.
* *Initiatives*: title of the initiative. 
* *Signatures*: sum of online and in-person signatures.
* *Created at*: date of creation of the initiative. 
* *Published at*: date of publication of the initiative. 

You can filter and sort this list by clicking the "Filter" button and the columns headers. 
You can also search for initiatives by their title in the search bar.

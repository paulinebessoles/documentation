= Assemblies

== Understand the basics

An assembly is a group of members of an organization who meet periodically to make decisions about a specific area or
scope of the organization.

Assemblies can hold meetings, consult their members, can be private or open to everyone. 

Examples of assemblies are: a general assembly meeting once a year to define the organisation's main lines of action as well as its
executive bodies by vote, an equality advisory council meeting regularly to make proposals on how to improve
gender relations in the organisation, an evaluation commission meeting every month to monitor a process, or a guarantee
body collecting incidents, abuses, or proposals to improve decision-making procedures.

NOTE: The main difference between xref:admin:spaces/processes.adoc[participatory processes] and assemblies is that assemblies don't
have phases, meaning that they don't have timelines.

In this documentation section, you can find how to configure and manage all of those items: 

* xref:admin:spaces/assemblies/components.adoc[Components]

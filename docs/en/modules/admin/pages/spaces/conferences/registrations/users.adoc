= User registrations

== Understand the basics

After participants have registered, administrators can have access to their registration information. 
It allows the conference organizers to efficiently manage the participants to the conference, its tracks, etc. 

For example, it can follow this flow: 

. A participant registers to the conference
. They receive a pending registration notification
. They receive a pending registration email
. An administrator reviews and confirms the registration with the image:icons/action_activate.png[Confirm] button
. The participant receives a confirmed registration notification
. They receive a confirmed registration email with a calendar .ics file

== Configuration

=== Manage the registrations

To access the user registrations configuration, click in the secondary navigation panel on the "User registrations" item.

=== Confirm a registration 

Registration confirmations can be used before or after the conference. 
They can allow administrators to confirm participants that their registration was taken into account, or 
that they indeed attended the conference after it happened. 

Confirming registrations allow administrators to send a 
xref:admin:spaces/conferences/registrations/certificates.adoc[**Certificates of Attendance**] after the conference to 
all confirmed participants to the conference. 

=== Export the registrations

It's possible to export the registrations in multiple formats: .CSV, .JSON, and .XSLX.
The file with all the registered participants is directly downloaded on the administrator device.

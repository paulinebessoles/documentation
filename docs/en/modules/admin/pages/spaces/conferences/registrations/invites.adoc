= Invites

== Understand the basics

Administrators can invite participants to join the conference. 
They can invite already existing participants, with an account on the platform, but also people without account. 
Inviting a participant sends an email to the account email address, to encourage the participant to register to the conference. 

== Manage invites

To access the invites configuration, click in the secondary navigation panel on the "Invites" item.

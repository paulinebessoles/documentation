= Invites

== Understand the basics

Administrators can invite participants to join the conference. 
They can invite existing participants, with an account on the platform, as well as people without account. 
Inviting a participant sends an email to the account email address, encouraging the participant to register for the conference. 

== Manage invites

To access the invites configuration, click in the secondary navigation panel on the "Invites" item.

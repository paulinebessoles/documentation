= Media links

== Understand the basics

Conferences can have a section called "Media links" which shows a list of media files and links 
that are associated to the conference. It displays in a specific page of the conference: 

* Related documents and images from the xref:admin:spaces/conferences/attachments.adoc[attachments] section. 
* Media links from the media links section.

= Registrations

== Understand the basics

As an administrator of a conference you can manage the registrations for the conference directly from the platform.

To do so, you can use these administration sections:

* xref:admin:spaces/conferences/registrations/types.adoc[**Registrations Types**]: to define the ways to register.
* xref:admin:spaces/conferences/registrations/users.adoc[**User Registrations**]:to confirm the registrations.
* xref:admin:spaces/conferences/registrations/invites.adoc[**Invites**]: to invite participants to the conference.
* xref:admin:spaces/conferences/registrations/certificates.adoc[**Certificates of Attendance**]:to configure and send certificates
of attendance in PDF format to participants to the conference.

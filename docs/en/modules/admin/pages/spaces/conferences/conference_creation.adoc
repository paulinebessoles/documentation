## Creating the program

For creating the program of the conference you need to create a new xref:components/meetings.adoc[Meeting component] with the
dates and times of the different talks, workshops, sessions, etc. After publishing the meetings, it will be visible in the landing page
and there'll be a special navigation for these meetings so they're ordered by date and time.

== Understand the basics

A participatory process is a sequence of participatory activities with the aim of defining and making a decision on a specific topic.
For example, you could have a participatory process like this: 

. First filling out a survey for collect participants opinion;
. Then opening proposals;
. Discussing them in face-to-face or virtual meetings;
. Finally prioritizing them before implementation.

NOTE: You want to create a participatory process? Check the xref:admin:spaces/processes/process_creation.adoc[process creation] article. 

Examples of participatory processes are: a process of electing committee members (where candidatures are first presented,
then debated and finally a candidacy is chosen), participatory budgets (where proposals are made, valued economically,
and voted on with the money available), a strategic planning process, the collaborative drafting of a regulation or norm,
the design of an urban space or the production of a public policy plan.

A really important concept for making good use of Decidim is to understand the relationship between Phases and Components
in a participatory process in Decidim:

What this diagram is showing is that for a participatory process you can have different phases, like:

. Configuration & Presentation
. Diagnostic
. Proposal Creation
. Proposal Selection
. Results
. Evaluation
. Monitoring

Inside of every one of these Phases, you can enable the xref:admin:components.adoc[Components] you need.

You can find all the processes on the list in the administration panel, with:

* *Title*: title of the process. 
* *Created at*: date of creation of the process. 
* *Private*: if the process is opened to all participants or to only certain participants. 
* *Published*: if the process is published or no. 

You can filter and sort this list by clicking the "Filter" button and the columns headers. 
You can also search for processes by their title in the search bar.

= Assemblies types

== Understand the basics

In some cases it is necessary to organize assemblies by more than just children and sub-assemblies. 
This is where assemblies types can be useful, and add a layer of categorization. 
Participants are then able to filter assemblies by the assembly types you created. 

NOTE: Assembly types work similarly to xref:admin:spaces/processes/types.adoc[Process types].

== Manage assemblies types

To access the assembly types list, click the "Manage" button on the top right of the page, and click the "Assemblies type" menu item.

== Add assembly type to an assembly

To relate assemblies to assembly types, in the edition page of an assembly, select the assembly type under the section labelled Other.

== Filter by assembly types

If there is at least one assembly type defined and related to an assembly, a filter is displayed at the left of the assemblies list 
in the participant interface, allowing filtering of assemblies.

= Initiatives

== Understand the basics

An initiative is a specific type of participatory space, which can be created by any participant, independently 
of other channels or spaces. 
It works through the collection of online and/or in-person signatures for the organization to carry out a specific action, like 
modify a regulation, initiate a project, change the name of a department or a street, etc.

The promoters of an initiative can define its objectives, gather support, debate, disseminate it and define meeting 
venues where signatures can be collected from the attendees or debates open to other participants.

NOTE: A lot of the initiatives behaviour and settings is configurable in the initiative 
xref:admin:initiatives_initializer.adoc[initializer]. Ask the organization implementer if you have some doubts regarding your organization
configuration. 

Examples of initiatives types: 

* To add an item to an assembly agenda
* To perform a participatory process
* To create a new assembly
* To approve or modify a regulation
* To call for assemblies

Initiatives are to be distinguished from the other spaces because they can be used as a participatory tool promoted *by participants*. 
In other words, the initiatives are mechanisms for *semi-direct democracy* through which participants can promote a certain 
action of common interest by collecting a specific number of signatures. 

The role of the platform’s administrator, then, is somewhat different from that of the other participation spaces, as 
the organization has to enable the participants and offer them the necessary technical support and advice.

In this documentation section, you can find how to configure and manage all of those items:

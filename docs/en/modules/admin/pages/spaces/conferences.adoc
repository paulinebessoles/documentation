= Conferences

== Understand the basics

A conference is a collection of meetings arranged in a program, with a number of people invited as speakers, and other
information fields typical of large congresses or social events (registration, list of organizations that support or sponsor the
event, etc.) A conference can be a relevant event for an organization and its members, or take place as part of a participatory
process or follow a consultation.

In conferences, meetings components are displayed in a program form, with days and hours being listed like in an event program.

= Reported participants

== Understand the basics

There are cases where participants could go against the Terms of Service of the
platform, so it's useful to have the option for reporting and blocking participants.
You can block participants from the xref:participants/participants.adoc[participants
section in the administration panel] or through the "Reported participants" section.

== Configuration

=== Report a participant

Any logged in participant can report another participant through the "Flag" icon in the participant
profile.

After a participant has clicked in this action they need to provide a reason why they're making this report:

When an administrator or a moderator report a participant, they have additional options that allow them to 
directly block the user and hide all their contents. They have to give a justification for blocking this participant.

=== Manage reported participants

Reported participants are visible on the "Reported participants" section of the Global moderations panel.

You can find all the reported participants on the reported participant list in the administration panel, with: 

* *Name*: name of the participant, with a link to their profile.
* *Nickname*: nickname of the participant, with a link to their profile.
* *Reason*: why the participant is reported. If the participant that made the report has given extra
information it's possible to see it by hovering it.
* *Reported at*: when they were originally reported.
* *Reports count*: number of reports by different users.
* *Actions*: you can *Unreport* or *Block* the participant.

=== Block a participant

If a content has been mistakenly "Unreported" then you'll need to find it again in the public platform 
and report it again so you can moderate it.

Administrators need to provide a justification if they want to block a participant.

Once a blocked participant tries to log-in they see an error message:

Blocked participants names change for "Blocked user."

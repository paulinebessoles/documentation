= Reported content

When writing the Terms and Conditions of your platform, or your participation chart, you want to make sure that the 
participants respect the participation rules in the contents they're writing. 
All participants are able to report comments, proposals, debates, etc. 

== Report a content

Any logged in participant can report content, clicking on the "Report" button available next to the resource.

== Manage reported content

After a participant has reported a content, it appears in two sections of the administration panel:

* Global moderations panel
* Participatory space moderation panel

There you'll find first all the unprocessed reports if there's any, with: 
* *Id*: unique identifier of the reported content.
* *Type*: the kind of content reported, for instance comment, proposal, debate, etc.
* *Participatory Space*: which space this content belongs to.
* *Reported content URL*: link for seeing the content reported and see the context of the complaint.
* *Reason*: why the content is reported. If the participant that made the report has given extra
information it's possible to see it by hovering it.
* *Reported at*: when it was originally reported.
* *Count*: number of reports by different users.
* *Actions*: you can *Expand*, *Unreport* or *Hide*.

Once you moderate a content, it appears in the "Hidden" contents list, accessible at the top right of the page.

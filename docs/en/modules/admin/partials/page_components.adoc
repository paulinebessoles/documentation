= Components

== Understand the basics

As explained in the xref:admin:index.adoc[introduction page], to understand how Decidim works, you need to distinguish between *spaces* and *components*. 
The participatory spaces are the channels that citizens can participate through when public decisions are being taken, whereas participatory components are 
mechanisms that enable interaction between users of the platform and the various participatory spaces.

All components can be enabled in each space, for example you can enable three Proposals components in a same participatory process, or having all the 
components enabled in an assembly space.

== How to find it?

To configure components, click the *Components* item in any participatory space.

There, you are able to manage the already added components, configure them, add new ones, etc.

== Manage components

You can find all the components on the list in the administration panel, with:

* *Component name*: title of the component, given when creating or editing it. 
* *Component type*: type of the component. 
* *Component scope*: in a same space, components can have different scopes. 

== Create a component

To configure a new component, click the *Add component* from the upper right part of the screen and select the type of
component you want.

= Attachments

== Understand the basics

Attachments allow an administrator to upload static files to a space.

When a space is launched, it is important to provide citizens with as much information as possible about them so that they can participate with knowledge. 
That is why it is helpful to add files, documents, images with relevant information. 

These documents can be grouped in *Folders*. For example, for a participatory process of remodeling a square, folders could be created with information about possible uses, with plans, with economic information, etc.

They can be found on the space xref:admin:spaces/processes/categories.adoc[landing page] when the content block is enabled.

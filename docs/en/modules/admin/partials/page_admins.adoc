= Space administrators

== Understand the basics

You can give specific permissions to users in the different spaces, so they can only have access to some of the administration actions. 
These roles are administrators, moderators, collaborators, and valuators.

* *Administrators*: they can administer the space and change the space settings.
* *Collaborators*: they can see the space and its components before it's published and view the space settings.
They can't edit anything.
* *Moderators*: they can see the reported contents of the space and hide or unhide it.
* *Valuators*: they can evaluate proposals, give them answers and update their statuses. 

== How to find it?

To configure space administrators, click the "Process admins" or "Assembly admins"Â item in the corresponding space.

You can find all the administrators on the list in the administration panel, with:

* *Name*: name of the administrator account. 
* *Email*: email of the administrator account. 
* *Last log in date*: last time the administrator was logged in. 
* *Invitation accepted at*: date when the administrator accepted the invitation by clicking the link in the invitation email. 
* *Role*: administrator role.

=== Moderators

=== Valuators

A space valuator can review the proposals of the space that were assigned to them, by:

* change the status of the proposals, by accepting or rejecting them.
* give an answer to the proposals. 
* add a monetary value to the proposals, so they can be voted with the budget component.

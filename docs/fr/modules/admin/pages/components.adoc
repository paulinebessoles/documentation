== Understand the basics

Grâce aux fonctionnalités, un administrateur peut activer et configurer différents mécanismes de participation.
All components are available in all the different xref:admin:spaces.adoc[spaces].

When you create a participatory space, by default, it won't have any components in it.

=== How to find it?

Components are accessible in each xref:admin:spaces.adoc[space], through the administration secondary navigation bar.

To create a component, click the "Add component" button and select the type of component you want to create.

Once you start publishing components, participants see links to the different components appear in the space "Main data"
content block in the landing page, in the general search engine, and in the dedicated homepage content blocks.

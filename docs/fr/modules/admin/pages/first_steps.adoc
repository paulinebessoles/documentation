= Premiers pas dans Decidim

== En bref

=== Connectez-vous pour la première fois

Once you or your developers have successfully installed Decidim, and created an organization in the System panel, you should
receive an email asking you to complete your account creation.
Si vous n'avez pas reçu d'e-mail d'invitation, demandez à la personne responsable de l'administration du système de vous ajouter en tant qu'administrateur.

L'e-mail d'invitation vous redirige vers un formulaire pour que vous puissiez terminer la configuration de votre compte avec votre pseudo, votre nom et votre mot de passe.

=== Access the administration dashboard

After logging in, you can see the platform as a participant, but it's not where you can configure and manage the platform.
To access the administration dashboard, or administration panel, you can click in three different items:

. The "Admin dashboard" button at the left of the administrator header only administrators can see.
. The "Edit" button at the right of the administrator header.
. The "Admin dashboard" button in the drop-down list available when you click your account avatar.

The "Edit" button redirects to the administration of the space you're seeing in the participant panel, whereas the other two buttons
redirect to the administration dashboard.

=== Administrators terms of service

For your first time accessing to the administration of Decidim, you are asked to review the administration terms of service.
Click on the "I agree with this terms" button to be able to start configuring the platform.

Those terms of service can be useful for you if you start inviting other administrators to the platform, and you need them to be aware
of specific privacy rules, or anything relevant for them before they have access to the administration.

Those terms of service can be configured in the xref:admin:settings/configuration.adoc[Configuration panel].

=== Explanation of the dashboard

Once you accepted the administrator terms of service, you can see the dashboard.
On a new instance, almost no data is displayed, but you can see how it looks like on an active instance:

You can see several sections on this page:

. *Pending moderations*: highlights the number of pending moderations, reported users and contents combined.
. *Activity*: number of participants and admins that logged in the last month, last week and last day.
. *Metrics*: the graphics for the evolution of multiple components inside of Decidim:
. *Admin log*: last actions made by all the administrators in the platform.

=== Administration navigation

To navigate in the administration panel, you can click in all of the items displayed in the vertical navigation bar on the left.

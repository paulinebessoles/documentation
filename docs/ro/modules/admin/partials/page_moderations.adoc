= Moderation

Moderations inside of a space work like xref:global_moderations.adoc[Global moderations].

The main difference is that if you can invite Moderators of this specific space in the
xref:admin:spaces/processes/admins.adoc[space admins] section, so they only have access to the reports made for
contents of this space.

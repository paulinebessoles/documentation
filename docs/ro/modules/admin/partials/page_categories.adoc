= Categories

== Understand the basics

Categories (and subcategories) are used for classifying resources inside of a space.

An administrator can define them, can be assigned to when creating resources, and then participants can filter the
different resources by these categories. For instance, they can be used in proposals, meetings, and debates.

. Administrators define categories in a space.
. Participants can create resources and give them a category.
. Participants can then filter by categories.

NOTE: Once a category is in use it can't be deleted, as there are resources that are linked to it.

Decidim has other ways to classify resources, for instance xref:admin:settings/scopes.adoc[Scopes] and
xref:admin:features/social_features/hashtags.adoc[Hashtags].
The main difference is that Categories can be defined in a given space, Scopes are global for all the platform, and Hashtags
can be defined by the participants.

Categories can be nested, meaning that a category can have subcategories.

== How to find it?

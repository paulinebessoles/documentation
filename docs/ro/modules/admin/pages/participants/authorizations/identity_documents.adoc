= Identity documents authorization

This authorization allows a participant to upload its identity documents into the platform, and get their account verified.
These documents depend on the organization, they could be a driver's license, a passport, a national identity card,
a club membership card, etc.

NOTE: If you don't want to collect any data, you should turn it off in the xref:configure:system.adoc[System panel].

These documents are reviewed by an administrator who can accept or reject them. It's possible to do this process
in two ways:

* *Online*: the participant is asked to upload the documents, and the administrator reviews these documents.
* *Offline*: the participant is asked to fill in some data, and then they need to go to a physical place
to show their documents face to face.

== Configuration

Click the "Config" button to configure the authorization.

|At least one method must be selected. Options: Online and/or Offline.

|Instructions for offline verification
|Required (if offline is selected)
|Directions that participants need to follow to verify their documents when offline verification is selected. For instance,
do they need to go to a specific place to show their documents? Is this place open some days of the week? Is it open

|===

== Online verification

The process is:

. Participants fill in their document type and number and upload a copy of their document.
. An administrator fills in the information present in the uploaded image.
. The information should match whatever the user filled in.
. If the administrator can't see the information or they can't get it verified, they can reject the request and
the user will be able to fix it.

=== 1. Participant authorization creation

By going to the authorization section in its profile, or by clicking on the action button if this permission is requested,
a participant can see the form for uploading a copy of their document. They also need to fill in their document type and number.

NOTE: You can change the document types options by xref:customize:code.adoc[customizing or overriding the code].

=== 2. Administrator document review

After this document is uploaded, an administrator can review it by going to the Identity documents section in the administration
panel.

After clicking on the verification id link or on the document, the administrator needs to review the image and fill in
the document number in the field. This number needs to match with the one provided by the participant.

=== 3. Administrator decision

There are two actions an administrator can do:

* Verify: the system checks if the document numbers entered by administrator and user are the same.
* Reject: the participant have to edit their authorization if they want to get verified.

If the request is rejected then the participant can provide other pictures or document.

Once a participant is verified, their documents are deleted from the list.

== Offline verification

The process is:

. Participants fill in their document type and number.
. Participants follow the instructions provided to them. For instance, if they need to go to a specific place in a
specific time to show their documents.
. An administrator go to the "Offline verification" panel and fills in the information present in the physical documents.
. The information should match whatever the user filled in.
. If the administrator can't see the information or they can't get it verified, they can reject the request and
the user is then able to fix it.

For this authorization to work, an administrator need to first configure it in the administration panel with the instructions explaining
what the participant need to do to finish the verification process.

=== 3. Administrator decision

In the cases where the verifications don't match (meaning that the email or the document number provided by the
participant and the ones filled by the administrators aren't the same), then the participant needs to edit it within their
user account.

== Both

It's also possible to enable both of these verifications methods. In this case, the participant has to choose
which kind of verification they want to do.

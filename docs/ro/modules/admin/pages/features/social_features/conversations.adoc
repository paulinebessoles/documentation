= Conversations

== Understand the basics

With conversations, participants can send private messages to another participant, a group of participants, or to user groups.
Only the participants who are in the conversation can see each message.

NOTE: It's not possible to delete a conversation nor to edit a message in a conversation.

=== How to find it?

As a signed in participant, you can access your conversations from two places:

. Click in your avatar in the header, and then click in the "Conversations" menu item
. Click in the "Conversations" link in the footer, in the "My account" section

If there are notifications, the participant sees a small badge next to their avatar, and in the dropdown menu.

== Configuration

=== Start a conversation

A participant can start a conversation with any participant or group registered on the platform.

=== Group conversations

Just like with participants, it is possible to have conversations with groups.

= Sortitions

== Understand the basics

The Sortitions component allows to sort a number of proposals with random, yet reproducible, procedures that guarantees non-biased
and uniform distributions.

For example, it can be useful for sorting candidates for a jury, or participatory budgeting proposals.

To conduct a sortition, you need a dice or another random way to generate a number from 1 to 6, as well as witnesses.

== Configuration

To create a Sortitions component, first go in the xref:admin:spaces.adoc[participatory space] where you want to create it.

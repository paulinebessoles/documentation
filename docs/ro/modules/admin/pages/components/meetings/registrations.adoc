= Registrations

== Understand the basics

NOTE: This article is dedicated to registrations "On this platform" when creating or editing a meeting.

Through registrations you can have capacity control of the attendance for a meeting. With this feature for instance you can
limit how many people could attend the meeting, or you can know before the start of a meeting if you need to find a bigger
room to hold the meeting.

Enabling this feature adds a "Register" button so that participants can express their wish to go to the meeting.

Depending on how this feature is configured, then administrators can:

. define how many slots are available for controlling the maximum capacity for this meeting
. create a xref:_registration_form[custom registration form] to ask information to participants
. send xref:_invitations[invitations] to other participants or people not registered in the platform
. control attendance to the meeting through xref:_registration_code[registration codes]

== Configuration

=== Register for a meeting

When a participant clicks on the "Register" button, they get asked

* if they're representing a xref:admin:participants/groups.adoc[group].
* if they want to show publicly that they're attending to the meeting.

=== Registration form

This feature allows you to define a custom form like the xref:admin:components/surveys.adoc[Surveys] component to ask participants
for registration information.

To create a registration form, check the "Registration form enabled" on the registrations page, and click the "Save" button.
Then, you can click the "Registration form" button in the top right of the page.

=== Export all

You can export registrations in multiple formats: CSV, JSON and XLSX (Excel).

The exported data contains these fields:

* id: The registration id
* code: the xref:_registration_code[registration code] (if this feature is enabled)
* user/name: the name of the user
* user/email: the email of the user
* user/user_group: the group of the user if they have selected that they represent a group when registering

=== Invitations

This feature allows you to invite attendees to a meeting. They can be active participants or non-existing participants
in the platform.

=== Registration code

This feature allows you to check if an attendee is well registered in the meeting.

After registering, the participant is given a registration code in the confirmation email and on the meeting page.

The validation of the code is pending. It means that when attending the meeting, the attendee has to give the code to an organizer
to validate it.
The organizer then enters the code in the "Validate registration code" field, to confirm that it exists in the database.

Once the code has been verified, the attendee is considered to have participated in the meeting and the code is marked as validated.

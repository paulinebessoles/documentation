== Understand the basics

Proposals answers allow administrators or valuators to review a proposal and give it an official response, with associated statuses.
It allows then to filter the proposals by their statuses, read the answer that was given, and import the accepted proposals in the
xref:components/budgets.adoc[budgets] component.

NOTE: To learn more about valuators, refer to xref:admin:participants/admins.adoc#_valuators[Valuators administrators].

You can control when the answers are published by using the "Publish proposal answers immediately" checkbox in the proposal configuration.
For enabling automatic publication, check this box.

If you want to control when to publish the answers of a proposal or multiple proposals, follow these steps:

. Don't tick the "Publish proposal answers immediately" checkbox in the proposal component configuration
. Answer the proposals (answers are not published yet)
. When you want to publish the answers, select the proposals
. Click on the "Actions" button
. Click on the "Publish answers" option

Then, click the "Publish" button.

NOTE: If you have unchecked the "Publish proposal answers immediately" then answered the proposals, and then checked the option again,
the answers aren't published automatically. You still need to publish the answers manually with the "Actions" button.

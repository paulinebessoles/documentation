The participants tab allow you to make certain tasks with participants, among them:

* To manage access rights to the platform administration
* To contact participants
* To manage participants access to specific spaces
* To certify the identity of specific participants
* To certify the authenticity of user organizations or collectives

== Configuration

To access the Participants configuration panel, go in the administration panel and click the "Participants" item in the administration navigation bar.

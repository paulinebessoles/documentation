= Registration types

== Understand the basics

Registrations are one of the specificity of the conference space, as they can allow participants to register to the whole conference,
to certain days only, or to specific tracks for example, rather than registering meeting by meeting.

NOTE: If you want to enable registration you'll need to define and publish at least one registration type.

Administrators can configure those different types of "tickets" in the registration types section:

. Define the registration types
. Enable registrations when it's ready
. Participants are then able to register and choose the fit type of registration

Once registrations are enabled, participants can click a button to register to the conference in the landing page
and the conference's header.

=== Register as a participant

If the participant isn't logged in, when clicking on one of the "Register" buttons, they can log in or create an account,
and see the registration types.

If the participant is logged in, when clicking on one of the "Register" buttons, they can directly register.
